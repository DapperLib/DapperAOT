# DAP004

Dapper.AOT runs on interceptors, which requires at least C# 11. The language version is implied by
your target .NET version, but can be changed manually - it is fine to use a different language
version than the default for that target runtime, especially when going "higher". For example, you
can use C# 12 on a project that targets .NET Framework (as long as you have up-to-date build tools).

The easiest way to do this is via `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>`.
