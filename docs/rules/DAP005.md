# DAP005

You're seeing this message because Dapper.AOT has found at least one place where it *could* help, and it
isn't explicit whether you want it to do so.

Dapper.AOT doesn't change any behaviours without your permission. You can *enable* (or disable) Dapper.AOT
at any level by adding a `[DapperAot]` (or `[DapperAot(false)]`) attribute.

To enable Dapper.AOT globally, add (usually to `AssemblyInfo.cs`, although it doesn't matter where):


``` csharp
[module: DapperAot]
```

Alternatively, if you only want it in a few places, use:

``` csharp
[module: DapperAot(false)]
```

and add `[DapperAot]` at more specific levels - types, individual methods, etc.
