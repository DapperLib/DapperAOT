# DAP016

As discussed in [DAP015](DAP015), Dapper.AOT wants to understand your data at compile-time, and it can't do that when generics are involved.

Specifically, you can't use a `T args` (or `TSomething args`) as the parameters to a Dapper call.

Either use non-generic arguments when calling Dapper, or disable Dapper.AOT with `[DapperAot(false)]`.
