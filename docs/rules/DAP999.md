# DAP999

Well this is embarrassing; something completely unexpected happened. I don't know what, but if you
could [report it](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues/), we can try to take a look.

Please include any information you think might be relevant to ... whatever it says happened.

Things that might matter:

- what **exactly** did the message say?
- anything unusual in your code?
- what library versions of Dapper / Dapper.AOT / Dapper.Advisor are you using?
- what runtime (.NET 7, etc) are you using?
- what build SDK are you using? (`dotnet --version`)
- are you using an IDE (if so: which?) or the command-line?
- what operating system are you using?
