# DAP015

To handle parameters efficiently, Dapper.AOT first needs to understand what you're doing. If your parameter data is `object`, `dynamic` etc,
then we can't do that at compile-time, so: Dapper.AOT can't help.

Either used typed parameters, or disable Dapper.AOT (`[DapperAot(false)]`).

If you're using `DynamicParameters`, note that this is often *wildly* overused. If your usage looks like

``` csharp
var args = new DynamicParameters();
args.Add("id", 42);
args.Add("name", "Fred");
conn.Execute("somesql", args);
```

then you can make this *much* more efficient (and Dapper.AOT-friendly) with simply:

``` csharp
conn.Execute("somesql", new { id = 42, name = "Fred" });
```

If you're using `DynamicParameters` for things like output-parameters, Dapper.AOT has new options for that; you can use `[DbValue(Direction = ...)]` on
properties of a custom type.
