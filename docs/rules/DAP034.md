# DAP034

`[CommandProperty<T>]` allows additional properties to be specified against a particular command type, but it is intended for things that Dapper.AOT
*doesn't* handle internally. The option you've specified should is reserved for internal handling. If this presents a problem, [log an issue](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues).
