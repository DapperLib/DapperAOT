Executing dynamically generated SQL inside SQL can be a cause of all the same problems as unparameterized SQL, including SQL injection and performance (query plan cache misses).

It looks like you're executing SQL that you've composed dynamically. This *could* be safe, but: you should ideally use [`sp_executesql`](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-executesql-transact-sql), taking
care to correctly **fully** parameterize any inputs.

This is a **complex topic**; please consult the SQL documentation carefully, as incorrect usage may present a security vulnerability.

Bad:

``` sql
exec ('select * from Customers where Name = ''' + @s + '''');
```

Good:

``` sql
exec sp_executesql
    N'select * from Customers where Name = @name', -- parameterized SQL to execute
    N'@name nvarchar(100)', -- parameter declarations (comma-delimited)
    @s; -- arguments (comma-delimited)
```

Note that rather than *compose the value* of `@s` into SQL directly (with [predictable results](https://xkcd.com/327/)) , we're
leaving the query parameterized (`select * from Customers where Name = @name'`), passing the *value* `@s` as an argument. Note
also that the parameter names *inside* the executed query (`@name` in this case) do not need to match.
