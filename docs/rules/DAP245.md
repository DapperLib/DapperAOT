# DAP245

There is a non-zero chance of Dapper treating character sequence in SQL query like `? something ?` as a pseudo-positional parameter,
even if that is not an actual pseudo-positional parameter like in this example:
```sql
select '?this is my string data?' 
```

See [github issue](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues/60) for more details.

Not recommended:

``` sql
select '?this is my string data?' 
```


To mitigate, you can split the string via concatenation:

``` sql
select '?this is ' + 'my string data?' 
```
