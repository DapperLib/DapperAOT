It is possible for an identifier to be *technically valid* to use without quoting, yet highly confusing As an example, the following TSQL is *entirely valid*:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE GO (GO int not null)
GO
INSERT GO ( GO ) VALUES (42)
GO
SELECT GO FROM GO
```

However, this can confuse readers and parsing tools. It would be *hugely*
advantageous to use delimited identifiers appropriately:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE [GO] ([GO] int not null)
GO
INSERT [GO] ( [GO] ) VALUES (42)
GO
SELECT [GO] FROM [GO]
```

Or... maybe just use a different name?
