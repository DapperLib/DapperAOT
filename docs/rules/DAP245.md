# DAP245

There is a non-zero chance of Dapper treating character sequence in SQL query like `?something?` as a pseudo-positional parameter **inside of a literal**,
even if that is not an actual pseudo-positional parameter like in this example:
```sql
select '?this_is_my_string_data?' 
```

_Note: it will not be considered a pseudo-positional parameter in case there are spaces:_
```sql
select '?this is not pseudo-positional?' 
```

See [github issue](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues/60) for more details.

To mitigate, you can split the string via concatenation:
``` sql
select '?this_is' + 'my_string_data?' 
```
