# DAP245

Dapper.Vanilla does not handle pseudo-positional parameters in the string correctly. And since Dapper.AOT uses Dapper.Vanilla, it also has this issue.
See [github issue](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues/60) for more details.

Not recommended:

``` sql
select '?this is my string data?' 
```


To mitigate, you can split the string via concatenation:

``` sql
select '?this is ' + 'my string data?' 
```
