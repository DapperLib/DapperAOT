# DAP236

Dapper tries to only use parameters that are included in your query; it does this using basic
pattern matching, but it looks like when analyzed properly: this parameter is not actually used.
This might be because the parameter name is used in a comment or string literal.

Try to restructure the query, or rename the parameter members, so that there is no confusion.
