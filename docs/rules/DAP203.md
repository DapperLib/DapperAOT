# DAP203

`@@identity` is the [global identity function](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/identity-transact-sql), and returns the last-inserted identity value; it is considered deprecated and actively harmful, as
it is very hard to predict what value it represents, especially when things like triggers are in play. It is also limited to a single value, where-as `insert` can be multi-row.

You should use `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` instead of `@@identity`, or (preferably) use [the `OUTPUT` clause](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/output-clause-transact-sql).

Bad:

``` sql
insert SomeTable (A) values (1)
select @@identity
```

Better:

``` sql
insert SomeTable (A) values (1)
select SCOPE_IDENTITY()
```

Best:

``` sql
insert SomeTable (A)
output inserted.Id
values (1)
```
