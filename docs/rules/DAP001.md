# DAP001

We're focusing on delivering the most common Dapper scenarios first; not everything currently has AOT support.

The good news is: we'll just let regular vanilla Dapper handle the code, so it should still work fine. Just; without AOT. Sorry.

If you think a particular API deserves attention: [*let us know*](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/issues)..
