# DAP011

Historically, Dapper has bound tuples *positionally*, because it does not have access to name metadata.

It looks like you have bind-by-name semantics enabled (`[BindTupleByName]`), and you're using named tuples - so you
probably expect this query to be bound ... by name; however, this query is going to be executed by vanilla non-AOT Dapper,
so: that won't happen.

Suggestions:

- remove `[BindTupleByName]` or use `[BindTupleByName(false)]` to explicitly acknowledge that you're using positional binding
- find out why Dapper.AOT can't help with this method, and fix that - maybe add `[DapperAot]`?
- use a regular non-tuple type - maybe a `struct record`
- remove the names from the tuple (because: they don't have any effect here)

As an example of the `struct record` suggestion:

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql");
// ...
public readonly record struct MyData(string name, int id);
```
