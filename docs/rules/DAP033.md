# DAP033

`[CommandProperty<T>]` allows additional properties to be specified against a particular command type, for example:

``` csharp
[CommandProperty<OracleCommand>(nameof(OracleCommand.FetchSize), 1024)]
```

Unfortunately, the property you specified *doesn't seem to exist*. So... we can't do that, sorry. Check again? `nameof` is highly recommended.
