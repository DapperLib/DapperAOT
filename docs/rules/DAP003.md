# DAP003

Interceptors are a new feature, and require some project configuration.

The exact shape of this has changed repeatedly, so this guidance is not complete yet.

Things that might be involved, depending on what preview build SDK you're using:

- `<Features>$(Features);InterceptorsPreview</Features>`
- `<InterceptorsPreviewNamespaces>$(InterceptorsPreviewNamespaces);Dapper.AOT</InterceptorsPreviewNamespaces>`

This will be clarified for release.
