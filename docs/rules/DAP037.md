# DAP037

When materializing results, Dapper needs to be able to assign values. It can do this in a range
of ways, including:

- accessible fields that are not `readonly`
- accessible `set` accessors
- accessible `init` accessors
- constructors (using `[ExplicitConstructor]` to select if ambiguous)

If there are *no* accessible members: you're not going to get very interesting results, hence this warning!
