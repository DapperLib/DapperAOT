# DAP013

Dapper.AOT does not currently support tuple-type results. It absolutely *will*; I just haven't got there yet.

This includes both positional and nomimal usage, i.e. `Query<(int, string)>` and `Query<(int id, string name)>`.

Suggestions:

- use a regular non-tuple type - maybe a `struct record`
- use vanilla Dapper by adding `[DapperAot(false)]`
- use a non-tuple type as the result, noting that this will be bound by position **only** (see [DAP011](DAP011))


As an example of the `struct record` suggestion:

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql");
// ...
public readonly record struct MyData(string name, int id);
```
