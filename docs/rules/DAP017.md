# DAP017

Dapper.AOT works by generating code to handle your types; to do that, those types need to be accessible to the generated code; that means they must have
at least `internal` accessibility.

Since Dapper.AOT is adding code to your assembly, this problem is limited to nested types that are `private`, `protected`, `private protected`, or similar - 
basically anywhere where *any other part of your code* couldn't mention the type by name.

Suggestions:

- make the type `internal`:
  - `private` => `internal`
  - `protected` => `protected internal`
- disable Dapper.AOT (`[DapperAot(false)]`)



> Can Dapper.AOT not just generate the code inside the relevant types via `partial` types?

No; generators are limited to placing their output in pre-defined namespaces, which precludes generating code directly inside your types.
We may be able to revisit this at a later date by having you add additional configuration to your project file, allowing Dapper.AOT to generate inside *your* namespaces.
