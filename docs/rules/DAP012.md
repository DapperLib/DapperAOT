# DAP012

As explained in [DAP006](DAP006), Dapper.AOT can make use of the names in tuple syntax (for example `(id: 42, name: "abc")`). However, because this represents
a change from runtime-only Dapper, we want to be sure that this is what you *wanted*.

To help clarify your intent, please add `[BindTupleByName]` or `[BindTupleByName(false)]` to enable/disable use of name data. Or alternatively,
just use an anonymous type instead of a tuple:

Ambiguous (unless `BindTupleByNameAttribute` is specified):

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql", (id: 42, name: "abc"));
```

Always clear:

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql", new { id = 42, name = "abc" });
```
