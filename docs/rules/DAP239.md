# DAP239

It is not *quite* true that any operation involving a `null` yields `null`. There *are exceptions*, in particular
when a null literal (or something that is *very close* to a null literal) is involved.

Examples:

- `null >> 2`
- `2 >> null`
- `null & null` (needs at least one operand that is not hard null)

Unusually this only applies to null literals; if you had a parameter/local that had a `null` *value*,
the expression would evaluate to `null` as expected.
