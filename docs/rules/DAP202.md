Like in most languages, SQL local variables must be uniquely named. If you're seeing this, it means you have something like:

``` sql
declare @id int;
-- some code...
declare @id int;
```

Simply change the name of one of the variables, or remove the redundant copy.

Note that the *scope* of SQL variables is "anywhere later in the code"; you cannot
re-declare a local in a branch. For example, this is not valid:

``` sql
if -- some test
begin
    declare @id int
    -- more code
end
else
begin
    declare @id int
    -- more code
end
```

You *can*, however, assign to `@id` in the `else` branch *without* declaring it there, since
we are later in the code. Likewise, we can read `@id` below (and outside) the `if` scope. SQL has
weird scope/declaration behavior!
