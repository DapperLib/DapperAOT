# DAP014

As explained in [DAP006](DAP006), Dapper.AOT can make use of the names in tuple syntax (for example `(id: 42, name: "abc")`). That's the theory. In practice,
we haven't implemented that just yet, so ... it isn't going to work. Hey, we're human.

Maybe just use an anonymous type instead?

Not yet supported:

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql", (id: 42, name: "abc"));
```

Good:

``` csharp
var data = conn.Query<MyData>("somesql", new { id = 42, name = "abc" });
```
