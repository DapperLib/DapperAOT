# DAP206

General SQL parse error. The message will probably tell you what you're doing wrong (assuming that you're [using the right SQL variant](/sqlsyntax)), so: read that?

If that fails, try executing your query (either simply by running your application, or in your DB-specific tool such as SQL Server Management Studio),
and see what happens.
